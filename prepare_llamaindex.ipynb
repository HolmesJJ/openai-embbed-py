However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n...</td>\n",

Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n...</td>\n",

Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease, where the pancreas is not working efficiently or sufficiently. \\n\\nType 1 diabetes will require a regular dose of insulin, as prescribed by a doctor. Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease.

However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n...   \n",
       "2  question: Can we store glucose in our body?\\nanswer: Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>question: Does white rice cause diabetes?\\nanswer: Although recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health and the National University Health System found that white rice has a high Glycaemic Index (GI), it is important to understand its overall health impact when taken as a part of our daily meals. GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control. Moderation is key.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>question: Do I need to follow a low carb diet?\\nanswer: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>question: Will cutting carbohydrates completely cure diabetes?\\nanswer: Diabetes is an incurable condition that can be well-controlled. Cutting out carbohydrates completely is not recommended. A person who avoids carbohydrates completely is susceptible to low blood sugar levels and is likely to suffer from long-term deficiencies due to a lack of carbohydrate-containing food. In serious situations, hypoglycemia can result in diabetic comas that may be life-threatening, especially for those who are not consuming sufficient carbohydrates and are currently on diabetic medications. A balanced diet is essential for diabetes management. Eat more wholegrains instead of refined grains, and enjoy a variety of other carbohydrate-containing food, including low-fat yoghurt, fruits, beans and vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and sweet potatoes. It is advisable that carbohydrates form around 50 percent of the daily diet. Consult a dietitian for the recommended quantity as this differs for each individual.\\n</td>\n",

Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n</td>\n",

Those with good glycaemic control should also exercise caution by eating sweets sparingly. Regular blood sugar monitoring is important when having sweet treats.\\n</td>\n",

Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>question: How does Type 1 differ from Type 2 diabetes?\\nanswer: Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease, where the pancreas is not producing insulin at all. Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease, where the pancreas is not working efficiently or sufficiently. The onset of type 1 diabetes is often sudden, affecting children and young people below the age of 30. While more young and overweight people have developed type 2 diabetes in recent years, it usually occurs in the 40s. The cause of type 1 diabetes may be unknown; however, some people develop it after a bout of illness such as a viral infection. For type 2 diabetes, many have a family history of the disease. People with type 1 diabetes will need insulin injections for life, but type 2 diabetes can be controlled by adopting proper diet, exercise, and with medication.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n</td>\n",

       "1   question: Does white rice cause diabetes?\\nanswer: Although recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health and the National University Health System found that white rice has a high Glycaemic Index (GI), it is important to understand its overall health impact when taken as a part of our daily meals. GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control. Moderation is key.\\n   \n",
       "2   question: Do I need to follow a low carb diet?\\nanswer: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Cutting out carbohydrates completely is not recommended. A person who avoids carbohydrates completely is susceptible to low blood sugar levels and is likely to suffer from long-term deficiencies due to a lack of carbohydrate-containing food. In serious situations, hypoglycemia can result in diabetic comas that may be life-threatening, especially for those who are not consuming sufficient carbohydrates and are currently on diabetic medications. A balanced diet is essential for diabetes management. Eat more wholegrains instead of refined grains, and enjoy a variety of other carbohydrate-containing food, including low-fat yoghurt, fruits, beans and vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and sweet potatoes. It is advisable that carbohydrates form around 50 percent of the daily diet.

Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "14  question: How is diabetes treated?\\nanswer: Type 1 diabetes will require a regular dose of insulin, as prescribed by a doctor. Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "15  question: How does Type 1 differ from Type 2 diabetes?\\nanswer: Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease, where the pancreas is not producing insulin at all. Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease, where the pancreas is not working efficiently or sufficiently. The onset of type 1 diabetes is often sudden, affecting children and young people below the age of 30. While more young and overweight people have developed type 2 diabetes in recent years, it usually occurs in the 40s. The cause of type 1 diabetes may be unknown; however, some people develop it after a bout of illness such as a viral infection. For type 2 diabetes, many have a family history of the disease. People with type 1 diabetes will need insulin injections for life, but type 2 diabetes can be controlled by adopting proper diet, exercise, and with medication.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
