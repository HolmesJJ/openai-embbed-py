  {
    "question": "Can I eat as much as I want, as long as I cut down on my carbohydrate intake?",
    "answer": "Excessive intake of any nutrient, including protein, may lead to weight gain. It would be advisable to know your body's requirements for all nutrients and keep to them."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it okay to eat my favourite sweets when I have low blood glucose?",
    "answer": "Yes, but in moderation. When going outdoors, keep sweets like Mentos on hand and consume one at a time if you experience symptoms of hypoglycemia (i.e. blood glucose level < 4.0 mmol/L). If you are in a safe space indoors, it is recommended to follow the 15/15 rule. Consume 15g of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as half a can of soft drink (e.g. Original Coca Cola) or half a glass of fruit juice. Then, have 15 minutes of rest. Afterwards, maintain your blood glucose level by consuming 15g of long-acting carbohydrates, such as 1 slice of bread or 3 pieces of plain biscuits. Take note to avoid highly sugary snacks, as overeating may cause your blood glucose levels to rise too much. Also, avoid taking beverages such as Milo and coffee which contain fat and prevent absorption of glucose into your bloodstream."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have diabetes, does that mean I can never consume fruits?",
    "answer": "People with diabetes should still eat all kinds of fruits, as they are rich sources of antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and fibre. Consume 2 portions of fresh fruit a day, but try to avoid fruit juices."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I have diabetes, does that mean I can never consume starchy foods?",
    "answer": "No. Carbohydrate foods, particularly starchy foods such as rice, bread, noodles and cereals, form a major component of the body's energy source. All starchy foods break down to glucose, which is the body's preferred source of energy. The key is knowing how much your personalised requirements for carbohydrates are. Choose starchy foods that are high in fibre such as wholegrains."
  },
  {
    "question": "Since fat does not matter in relation to blood glucose levels, can I ignore the fat content in my meals?",
    "answer": "It is true that fat does not have a direct impact on blood glucose levels. However, a large amount of fat in a meal can delay stomach-emptying and slow the digestion of carbohydrates, keeping your blood glucose levels elevated for longer. This makes it difficult to keep your blood glucose levels within the desirable range. It should also be noted that fat provides nearly twice as many calories as carbohydrates and protein (gram for gram). This is not helpful for individuals hoping to shed some weight. Consuming too much saturated fat may also lead to undesirable lipid profiles, increasing your risk of cardiovascular diseases."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will losing weight cure my diabetes?",
    "answer": "If you are overweight, losing weight may not definitely cure your diabetes. Nonetheless, losing 5-10% of your initial weight may help you control your blood glucose levels by improving insulin resistance. In addition, keeping the weight off may also help control your blood lipids and blood pressure."

  {
    "question": "What are the different types of diabetes?",
    "answer": "There are 3 main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin, whereas in Type 2 diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or the insulin produced does not work. Type 1 diabetes most commonly presents in childhood and young adulthood. A family history puts a person at a slightly higher risk. Type 2 diabetes tends to occur in older people, above 40 years of age, especially those who are obese. Even though Type 2 diabetes is more common, it can be prevented. Type 1 diabetes can not."

  {
    "question": "What is HbA1c?",
    "answer": "HbA1c stands for haemoglobin A1c or glycated haemoglobin, which is haemoglobin to which glucose is bound. It is a blood test that estimates your average blood glucose level for the past 3 months. It is usually organised once every 3 to 4 months by your doctor at each visit to the clinic."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is testing my glucose levels with only HbA1c enough?",
    "answer": "Glucose levels can fluctuate markedly throughout the day. As the HbA1c is done only once every 3 to 4 months, periodically self-monitoring your capillary blood glucose levels and how high or low it has been can help you make timely changes to your lifestyle and dietary choices. You can easily check your glucose levels daily with a glucometer, or with a continuous glucose sensor."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a well-balanced diet consist of?",
    "answer": "A well-balanced diet consists of less sugar, less fat, less salt, and more fibre. Health Promotion Board's My Healthy Plate sets a good benchmark for the major food groups you should target to have in each meal. In one plate, half should be filled with fruits and vegetables, one-quarter with wholegrains, and the remaining one-quarter with meat and others."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are some strategies I can use to have a well-balanced diet?",
    "answer": "To consume less sugary foods, consider replacing sweetened beverages, sweets and cakes, with milk, fruit and wholemeal crackers. Tackle fatty foods by limiting intake of fried dishes and using less butter, ghee and coconut oil in cooking. Instead, opt for low fat cooking methods such as baking, boiling, grilling and steaming. To minimise salt intake, use less preserved food such as salted fish and canned meats, and more fresh products. Lastly, incorporate more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, wholegrain cereals and brains, and including fresh fruit and vegetables."

  },
  {
    "question": "How can I monitor my blood glucose levels during festive periods like Ramadan?",
    "answer": "During Ramadan fasting, you may experience decreased appetite, an urge to skip meals, and lower blood sugar levels. Hence, keep these tips on safe fasting in mind: 1) Delay having Suhoor, your pre-dawn meal, until it is as close as possible to the time for the Fajr prayer; 2) Eat sufficiently and moderately during Suhoor; 3) As soon as the sun has set, break the fast with Iftar without delay."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is my blood glucose level high in the morning even though I did not eat anything?",
    "answer": "There are several reasons why your blood glucose level may be high in the morning even if you haven't eaten anything: \n1. Even during fasting periods, your liver releases stored glucose into your blood. People with diabetes havea relatively higher glucose release from their liver, hence your glucose may be high even when you have not eaten anything. \n2. Your body may be producing stress hormones during an illness. Medications prescribed during illnesses (e.g. steroids) can also increase glucose levels. \n3. Consumption of larger meals, that are high in carbohydrates and fat, at late hours can lead to higher post-meal blood glucose levels over an extended period of time.,Hence, it is advised to consume your last meal 3 hours before bedtime and try brisk walking for 30 minutes daily. If you find yourself craving a late-night snack, opt for healthy snacks such as half an apple, or plain yoghurt with nuts."

  },
  {
    "question": "Can diabetes cause hypertension? What are the symptoms of hypertension?",
    "answer": "Diabetes is often associated with cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, or high blood pressure. Hypertension usually causes no symptoms, but over time, it can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to stroke, heart attack or renal failure. While hypertension is usually picked up during a routine medical examination, if it reaches dangerously high levels, it can cause physical symptoms like headaches, visual disturbances, chest pain, or feeling breathless."

  {
    "question": "What is diabetes?",
    "answer": "Diabetes is a chronic condition characterised by high glucose levels."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is glucose?",
    "answer": "Glucose comes from our food and is also produced by the liver. It is the main source of energy for the body's cells and is transported through the bloodstream. Glucose needs to enter cells to be used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is insulin? ",
    "answer": "Insulin is the hormone that acts like a 'key' to allow glucose to enter cells. If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or cells are not able to respond well enough to insulin, glucose is unable to enter the cells. Glucose levels in the bloodstream rise, resulting in diabetes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is diabetes diagnosed?",
    "answer": "The following several blood tests can be done to find out whether you have diabetes: \n1. Random blood glucose test: Measures blood glucoe level without fasting or regard to when you last ate. \n2. Fasting blood glucose test: Measures blood glucose level after an overnight fast for at least 8 hours. \n3. Oral glucose tolerance test: Measures blood glucose level before and 2 hours after you have consumed 75g of a sugary drink."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is diabetes treated?",
    "answer": "Type 1 diabetes will require a regular dose of insulin, as prescribed by a doctor. Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the complications of diabetes?",
    "answer": "Diabetes, when poorly-controlled, results in multiple complications. Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, limb amputation, heart attack and stroke."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I eat if I have diabetes?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I still consume alcohol if I have diabetes?",
    "answer": "Alcohol can interfere with your meal plan and blood glucose control, especially if you are taking insulin or medication for your diabetes. People with diabetes should avoid alcohol in general. But if you have to, remember to check your blood sugar levels before drinking to ensure that it is not too low. Accompany the drink with a carbohydrate-containing meal as alcohol can cause your blood sugar levels to drop drastically within 24 hours of drinking. Healthy individuals should drink responsibly. If you do not suffer from other health conditions and still want to drink, keep to only 1 drink for women, and 2 drinks for men. One drink is equal to 220ml of beer (about ⅔ of a can) or 100ml of wine or 30ml of spirits (about 1 shot glass)."

    "question": "What are some tips for staying motivated to exercise in the long term?",
    "answer": "We all know staying active and exercising regularly helps us stay healthy and in shape. But some days, it gets hard to stay motivated to work out when all we want to do is sit on our comfy sofas and watch TV or play video games. How do we stay motivated? Here are some tips: \n1. Break your 150 minutes of exercise per week into bite-sized chunks of 15 to 20-minute workots and fit them into your daily routine. For example, exercise during lunch hour by going for a brisk walk in the park. \n2. Add more physical activity into your daily life. For example, try to brisk walk while shopping at larger malls like IMM or Vivocity. \n3. Ask your family and friends to join in. This could be 30 minutes of brisk walking together with friends while catching up, or having a few rounds of family badminton at the neighbourhood park. \n4. If your exercise routine is starting to get old, try something new and exciting to pump up your enthusiasm. Consider HealthHub's wide range of workout classes, from Zumba outside Marina Bay Sands to aerobics at your neighbourhood mall."

  {
    "question": "Will eating and drinking too much sugary stuff cause diabetes?",
    "answer": "Consuming too much of anything, including sugary food and drink, will likely lead to obesity, a major cause of insulin resistance. Excessive consumption of sugar puts the pancreas under tremendous stress to produce enough insulin to match the spikes in blood sugar levels. Over time, this may increase the risk of insulin resistance, poor blood glucose control and diabetes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it possible to reverse Type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "There is currently no cure for Type 2 diabetes. However, there is enough evidence to suggest that bariatric surgery in obese patients causes diabetes to enter a remission phase. Although there is no cure for diabetes at this point in time, adhering to a healthy lifestyle coupled with regular check-ups and medication compliance can keep diabetes under good control and prevent complications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does diabetes really result in sugar in the urine?",
    "answer": "In healthy people, the kidney is able to absorb all of the sugar that it filters from the blood. In patients with previously undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes, the high sugar load in the filtered blood means the kidney is not able to absorb all of the sugar. As a result, large amounts of sugar are passed out in the urine. Sugar in the urine increases the risk of fungal infection of the external genitalia (e.g. thrush) and urinary tract infections. It also leads to the passing of large amounts of urine and, consequently, dehydration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does diabetes management mean only consuming foods labelled “sugar-free” or “suitable for diabetics”?",
    "answer": "Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) requires “sugar-free” products to contain no more than 0.5g of sugar per 100g or 100ml. These usually have less sugar than other similar products but may contain other artificial sweeteners like sorbitol. Food labelled “no added sugar” or “suitable for diabetics” can be misleading, as naturally occurring sugars or fat, and calorie content are not taken into consideration. It is crucial to read the nutritional information for any type of food to check the amount of carbohydrate, natural sugars and calories it contains. Products like fruit juices with “no added sugar” can still raise blood sugar levels as quickly as sugary drinks, since they contain natural fruit sugars. Snacks that use artificial sweeteners can still be high in carbohydrates, fat and calories even though they might be low in sugar. These products can affect blood sugar control and risk excessive weight gain — a major risk factor for diabetes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does having diabetes mean I must swear off sweets or chocolate forever?",
    "answer": "Those with poor blood sugar control should avoid sugary treats like sweets and chocolate, as these can quickly cause unwanted spikes in sugar levels and provide little nutrition. Those with good glycaemic control should also exercise caution by eating sweets sparingly. Regular blood sugar monitoring is important when having sweet treats."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will cutting carbohydrates completely cure diabetes?",
    "answer": "Diabetes is an incurable condition that can be well-controlled. Cutting out carbohydrates completely is not recommended. A person who avoids carbohydrates completely is susceptible to low blood sugar levels and is likely to suffer from long-term deficiencies due to a lack of carbohydrate-containing food. In serious situations, hypoglycemia can result in diabetic comas that may be life-threatening, especially for those who are not consuming sufficient carbohydrates and are currently on diabetic medications. A balanced diet is essential for diabetes management. Eat more wholegrains instead of refined grains, and enjoy a variety of other carbohydrate-containing food, including low-fat yoghurt, fruits, beans and vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and sweet potatoes. It is advisable that carbohydrates form around 50 percent of the daily diet. Consult a dietitian for the recommended quantity as this differs for each individual."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does white rice cause diabetes?",
    "answer": "Although recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health and the National University Health System found that white rice has a high Glycaemic Index (GI), it is important to understand its overall health impact when taken as a part of our daily meals. GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control. Moderation is key."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I make food choices based on their GI?",
    "answer": "In general, high GI foods raise blood sugar levels faster by releasing sugar quickly into the bloodstream. This is more useful for athlete's post-exercise or for patients with hypoglycemia. Some fad diabetes diets advise avoiding high GI foods completely. However, GI is just one measure of the nutritional value of food. Similarly, some low GI foods like cake, chocolate bars and potato chips are unhealthy and lack nutritional value, and are unsuitable for patients with type 2 diabetes. Maintaining a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables and carbohydrates, and regular exercise are the best ways to stay fit, prevent weight gain and stay healthy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I eat as many fruits as I want without affecting my diabetic condition?",
    "answer": "Fruits contain many vitamins, minerals and fibre, so it is great to include them in your meals. They also contain natural sugars and carbohydrates, so stick to the recommended two portions daily. Spreading out these two portions or eating them between meals can help to prevent sudden spikes in sugar, and help with blood sugar control. Pick fresh whole fruits instead of juiced, dried or canned ones as these can contain added sugar."
  },
  {
    "question": "What health problems does diabetes cause?",

    "answer": "Diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy) results from reduced blood flow to the light-sensing nerve layer of the eye (retina). Over time, there is formation of fragile and leaky new blood vessels and nerve layer swelling. These changes can progress to blindness if not identified early or treated. There are two ways diabetes can affect your eyes: 1. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy and occure when the blood vessels become affected and start to leak and bleed. At this stage, vision is usually not affected. 2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs when there is growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye and these new vessels can rupture, causing significant bleeding that will lead to loss of vision. \nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet."

    "question": "What can I do to prevent diabetes? OR What can be done to reduce the risk of diabetes?",
    "answer": "Keeping your weight in check, maintaining an active lifestyle and eating a healthy diet can help prevent most cases of type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. A balanced diet consist of less sugar/sugary foods, less fat/fatty foods and less salt/salty foods. Include more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, whole grain cereals and breads.

  {
    "question": "How can I test for blood glucose level?",
    "answer": "One way to test for blood glucose level is by using a glucometer. A glucometer is small and can be used at home, in clinics and health centres to aid in diabetes detection. The blood glucose test is a similar finger-prick test to indicate blood glucose level at that point in time. It is convenient and can be accurate if done properly. Anyone, even a child, can be taught to perform the test and it is essential for a person with diabetes to operate the glucometer. Another way is to take the HbA1c (haemoglobin A1c) test, which reflects average blood glucose control for a three-month period. Haemoglobin A1c in the red blood cells (glycohemoglobin) are glycated or sugar coated. The body usually replaces red blood cells every three months. This is usually done quarterly in the laboratory. The blood glucose and HbA1c tests are not universally accepted as diagnostic tests for diabetes mellitus. But, if the person has symptoms of diabetes mellitus with abnormal HbA1c and/or high blood glucose level on subsequent days, the doctor can then confirm the diagnosis.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."

Before taking the test, one must fast for at least eight hours before blood/plasma and urine samples are taken.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are ketones?",
    "answer": "Ketones are the by-products of fat metabolism. Ketones are acidic, and if excessive amounts accumulate in the body, can poison brain cells. This occurs when there is not enough insulin to allow glucose to enter the cells and fuel them, or when there are too much stress hormones. Excessive ketones in the blood can render a person unconscious. It can happen when a person suffers from type 1 diabetes mellitus and the onset is usually sudden. This is a serious condition called Diabetic Keto-Acidosis (DKA).\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)?",
    "answer": "Impaired glucose tolerance is a condition that occurs before one develops diabetes. It means that blood sugar levels are elevated but not elevated enough to warrant a diagnosis of diabetes. Usually, insulin and glucose levels are in equilibrium. If the blood glucose level is high, the body will produce more insulin to bring the glucose level down. This is called a feedback mechanism. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine, Healthline https://www.healthline.com/health/impaired-glucose-tolerance."
  },
  {
    "question": "I drink a lot of fruit juices or fizzy drinks. Does this cause diabetes?",
    "answer": "Your choice of beverage may not cause diabetes, as genetics also play a role in predisposing a person to diabetes. Nonetheless, fruit juices and fizzy drinks have high sugar content and are high in calories. When consumed in excess, these may cause obesity, which is a contributing factor for type 2 diabetes. Fruit juices are also high in fructose, another simple sugar like glucose. Over time, the pancreas will burn out and may not be able to produce sufficient insulin for the body to convert blood glucose into energy and to store glycogen. There will be a build-up of blood glucose in the red blood cells. This is the main sign of untreated or uncontrolled diabetes.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "I don't quite understand the concepts of insulin and glucose in our body.",
    "answer": "Put simply, the pancreas is the factory that produces insulin. Insulin is the key to control blood glucose. Glucose is fuel for the body. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when I eat?",
    "answer": "More than 75% of our food, mainly carbohydrates, are broken down into glucose when digested. Glucose enters the bloodstream, and the level of blood glucose begins to rise. When our body senses an increase in blood glucose, it sends a signal to the pancreas to produce more insulin to lower the blood glucose level. If the blood glucose level is still high, more insulin will be produced to enter the bloodstream. The insulin acts as a key to unlock the body's cells and allow glucose to pass from the bloodstream into the cells. The blood glucose level falls as glucose is transferred to the cells. The body cells use the glucose for fuel.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can we store glucose in our body?",
    "answer": "Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Type 1 differ from Type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease, where the pancreas is not producing insulin at all. Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease, where the pancreas is not working efficiently or sufficiently. The onset of type 1 diabetes is often sudden, affecting children and young people below the age of 30. While more young and overweight people have developed type 2 diabetes in recent years, it usually occurs in the 40s. The cause of type 1 diabetes may be unknown; however, some people develop it after a bout of illness such as a viral infection. For type 2 diabetes, many have a family history of the disease. People with type 1 diabetes will need insulin injections for life, but type 2 diabetes can be controlled by adopting proper diet, exercise, and with medication.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?",
    "answer": "Type 2 diabetes develops because the body becomes insulin resistant or does not respond effectively to natural insulin. This is possibly due to a defective gene factor. Initially, the pancreas may produce more insulin to cope with the increased blood glucose and to break down the food we eat. Usually, the patient needs anti-diabetic tablets or Oral Hypoglycaemic Agent (OHA) to control blood glucose. Eventually, the pancreas suffers a burnout and produces low levels of insulin. The diabetic patient may then need insulin injections.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is diabetes more common nowadays?",
    "answer": "In the past, we did not have many fast-food restaurants, high calorie beverages and rich foods. Fast food contains saturated fat, which is not easily broken down by the body and tends to deposit inside the blood vessels. Blood glucose and cholesterol levels will rise within the blood vessels. We also led more active lifestyles and children played outdoors instead of sitting in front of the television or computer. Seldom did we see children who were obese or very overweight. Today, we lead sedentary lives; some say that diabetes is a “New World Syndrome” – a disease due to urbanisation, high calorie diets, poor sedentary lifestyles, and bad habits. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "I often skip meals or eat only when I am very hungry. Why do I still have high blood glucose levels?",
    "answer": "Many people today tend to skip meals or eat at irregular hours because of work or poor lifestyle. When you skip a meal or eat only when you are very hungry, it is likely that you will have a heavy meal later. Your pancreas has to work doubly hard to produce more insulin to digest the food. When you skip a meal, the liver may release glucose into the blood. Over a period of time, the liver ‘learns to release glucose at odd times'. At the same time, the pancreas does not work efficiently, cannot produce sufficient or effective insulin. This is why some people with diabetes have high blood glucose levels, even when they do not eat. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do people with diabetes have heart diseases?",
    "answer": "Diabetes and heart diseases have a synergistic effect, which means that if a person has diabetes, he is likely to have heart disease as well and vice versa. That is why people with diabetes usually have more than one health problem. When the blood is thick with cholesterol and glucose, it increases the resistance and blood pressure. Just imagine, when a person has high blood pressure, the heart will have to pump harder to circulate blood in the body. Over a period of time, the blood vessels can become damaged from stress, illness, poor lifestyle, and diet. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do I feel thirsty all the time and experience frequent urination?",
    "answer": "When blood glucose level is too high and insulin is absent, the kidneys cannot reabsorb the excess glucose. This excess is then excreted in the urine. Whatever you drink is hence siphoned out of the body in the urine. The cells experience a water shortage, you feel thirsty, and your brain will signal you to drink more water. Frequent urination can be an early sign of high blood glucose levels. If you have been experiencing frequent urination, it is advisable for you to have your blood glucose level checked.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are diabetics prone to skin infections?",
    "answer": "When blood glucose is deposited inside the small blood vessels near the skin surface, the sluggish blood flow makes it easier for germs and fungi to multiply on the skin, especially in our warm and humid climate. Diabetics are prone to infections of the skin, mouth, urinary tract, and genital areas.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "I always feel hungry and eat a lot. But I noticed that I still lose weight. Why does this happen?",
    "answer": "If diabetes is not well-controlled, this can cause your body to starve, as well as you to feel hungry and eat more than ever. We need insulin because it acts as the key, to allow glucose to go in and out of the cells in the muscles and liver. When you do not have insulin, the muscles and liver cannot release the stored glucose or glycogen and convert it into fuel for your body. The body will then have to use fat and convert it into energy for the heart, lungs, and other body systems to function. This is why a person with undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes may lose weight.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common gastro-intestinal problems associated with diabetes?",
    "answer": "When a person has very high blood glucose levels, constipation is common. Initially, one may suffer from indigestion, nausea, and vomiting. Later, one may suffer from diarrhoea as the body tries to get rid of the waste.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does diabetes affect my vision?",
    "answer": "Blood glucose that are deposited in the small blood vessels can cause them to narrow and increase blood pressure in the eyes, causing glaucoma. When glaucoma occurs, the narrow-damaged blood vessels may leak, and this is called retinopathy. Cataract is a white layer over the lens of the eye. If diabetes is coupled with hypertension, it may result in a tear of the retina and cause severe bleeding of the eyes, which can lead to blindness. Hence, it is important to seek prompt medical treatment if you see ‘floaters', ‘curtain falling' or something unusual happening to your vision.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do I sometimes feel numb in my limbs, toes, and fingers?",
    "answer": "This is usually due to poor blood circulation. High levels of cholesterol and glucose in the blood can cause nerve damage or impede blood flow. Usually, numbness in the extremities, or the arms and legs, is an early sign of diabetes. With poorly controlled diabetes, you may first feel a tingling or burning sensation, or even numbness, when your blood glucose level is very high. Subsequently, the pain may worsen and is often described as a ‘stingy bite' or ‘nerve pain'. If the blood glucose level is not controlled over a period of time, you may lose all sensation in your lower limbs and feet. If you are experiencing numbness, it is best to consult a doctor to determine the cause. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does diabetes incapacitate?",
    "answer": "Some diabetics may accidentally cut the toe or foot and end up with a limb amputation. With poor blood circulation, the person may have lost all sensation in his feet and cannot feel pain. There is poor healing when infection sets in. The tissue in the leg becomes gangrenous and amputation may be required to save the patient's life. If you have diabetes, it is not safe to walk about barefooted. Pebble-stone reflexology is also highly discouraged because the sharp, rough stones may cut the feet.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can diabetes ruin my sex life?",
    "answer": "Our reproductive system is rich in blood supply and has many nerves. Our nerves are located just next to the blood vessels and can be affected if diabetes is poorly controlled. If you are a man with diabetes, you may experience impotence or erectile dysfunction, and face difficulty when engaging in sexual intercourse. It is thus encouraged to seek help in the early stages of diabetes, where impotence can be prevented or resolved through proper control of the blood glucose level. If blood glucose is not controlled over a period of time, neuropathy or permanent nerve damage may set in.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."

  {
    "question": "What do kidneys do?",
    "answer": "Kidneys are the main excretory organs with millions of microscopic filtering units called nephrons. Kidneys filter the blood, removing urea and waste products, excess sugar, salts, and water in the urine. Kidneys control the amount of water in your body. The more you drink, the more urine excreted out.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is so good about a high fibre diet?",
    "answer": "A high fibre diet consists of 2 servings of leafy vegetables and 2 servings of fruit per day. Fibre makes us feel full and we are unlikely to overeat. It stabilises the blood glucose level because it causes glucose to be absorbed into our bodies at a slower rate and gives insulin more time to work effectively. Fibre also prevents constipation and is good for the digestive system. \nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."

  {
    "question": "Can diabetics consume more brown rice and cereal?",
    "answer": "Brown rice and cereal are carbohydrates and a person with diabetes should limit their carbohydrate intake, as recommended by their dieticians. Brown rice, however, is considered to be healthier than white rice because it is unpolished and has more vitamins and fibre. The fibre in brown rice will keep a person feeling full longer.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."

However, the sugar content in jam comes from the fruit (fructose), and moderate consumption is advised. There is natural sugar in most of the foods we eat. For example, milk sugar (lactose) is found in dairy foods such as cheese and yoghurt. Chocolate sugar (maltose) can be found in malted beverages, and all types of flour, when absorbed in the digestive system, become glucose.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine."

    "question": "Can I still consume sweeteners if I am diabetic?",
    "answer": "Sweeteners can be safely consumed by diabetics as they do not increase blood sugar levels. They should, however, be taken in small amounts and occasionally. Excessive intake is not advisable because some sweeteners, based on certain forms of carbohydrate source, still contain calories. Sugar substitutes that are commonly available in Singapore include:\n    • Aspartame (found in Equal)\n    • Saccharin (Hermestas)\n    • Sucralose (Splenda)\n    • Stevia, a herbal product (Equal Stevia, Jovia)\n    • Xylitol, a plant-based sugar alcohol (XyloSweet)\n    • Acesulfame Potassium (found in carbonated drinks and protein shakes)\nSource: HealthXChange, HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthxchange.sg/food-nutrition/food-tips/artificial-sweeteners-how-safe\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/191/nutrition-hub/eat-less#:~:text=For%20baking%20and%20cooking%2C%20avoid,acesulfame%20K%20and%20sucralose%20instead\n\nQ&A taken from HealthH."

    "question": "What does insulin resistance mean?",
    "answer": "Insulin resistance means some body cells don't react properly to insulin – they cannot be unlocked to let in glucose from the bloodstream. \nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What causes insulin resistance and what can I do about it?",
    "answer": "One possible cause of insulin resistance is obesity and a high-calorie diet. A diet high in carbs, sugar, and fat increases calorie intake and contributes to obesity. Losing 5 to 10% of our body weight is enough to increase insulin sensitivity. Use My Healthy Plate or consult a dietician to guide you on how much to eat. Another cause of insulin resistance is lack of exercise. Do light workouts like walking and swimming to improve insulin insensitivity and help you lose excess weight. Insulin resistance may also be caused by factors like ethnicity, certain diseases, steroid use, some medications, older age, sleep problems, and smoking.\nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes\n."

    "question": "What does insulin shortage mean?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What causes insulin shortage and what can I do about it?",
    "answer": "Insulin shortage can be caused your diet and an overworked pancreas. Carbs and sugar get broken down into glucose. A high-carb, high-sugar diet means we need more insulin to process all that glucose. Over time, this could overwork and damage the pancreas, causing it to produce less insulin. To combat this, avoid eating too many portions of refined carbs (e.g., white rice, white bread) and sugary foods. Another possible factor that causes insulin shortage is obesity and a fatty pancreas. Obesity causes fat to gather in the pancreas. The more fat in the pancreas, the less insulin it makes. To shed pancreatic fat, you need to lose excess weight.\nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes."
