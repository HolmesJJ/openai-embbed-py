question: What are the benefits of high-fibre food?
answer: Firstly, fibre from fruits, veggies, and grains fills you up. You stay full longer and are less likely to overeat. Secondly, fibre takes longer to digest. Slower digestion means a slower rise in blood glucose, compared to food with little/no fibre. This helps you better manage your blood glucose.
