question: What kind of carbs should I consume?
answer: We need carbohydrates in our diet for energy, but some carbs are better than others when it comes to managing diabetes. Choose those that raise your blood glucose slowly. Try to choose wholegrains more often and refined grains less often. Examples of wholegrains are brown rice, oats, wholemeal bread, and whole wheat flour. Refined grains refer to white bread, white rice, and fine wheat flour. Basmati and cous cous fall in between these two categories.
