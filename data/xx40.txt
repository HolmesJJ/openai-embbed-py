question: Can I still consume alcohol if I have diabetes?
answer: Alcohol can interfere with your meal plan and blood glucose control, especially if you are taking insulin or medication for your diabetes. People with diabetes should avoid alcohol in general. But if you have to, remember to check your blood sugar levels before drinking to ensure that it is not too low. Accompany the drink with a carbohydrate-containing meal as alcohol can cause your blood sugar levels to drop drastically within 24 hours of drinking. Healthy individuals should drink responsibly. If you do not suffer from other health conditions and still want to drink, keep to only 1 drink for women, and 2 drinks for men. One drink is equal to 220ml of beer (about â…” of a can) or 100ml of wine or 30ml of spirits (about 1 shot glass).
