question: What should I eat if I have diabetes?
answer: People with diabetes do not need to embark on a special diet. Rather than a restrictive diet, a diet suitable for diabetes is simply a healthy eating plan that is individualised according to your requirements and lifestyle. It is recommended that you see a dietician to guide you on dietary changes that can help you control your blood glucose levels and manage your weight.
