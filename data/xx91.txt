question: Where should I inject insulin?
answer: Best spots to inject insulin are the upper arm and thigh. However, if you inject in the upper arm, use only the outer back area (where there is more fat) and use a shorter needle. If you inject in the thigh, use a shorter needle and avoid using the inner thighs.
