question: What can I eat if I have diabetes?
answer: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. Rather than a restrictive diet, a diet suitable for diabetes is simply a healthy eating plan that is individualized according to your requirements and lifestyle. You can see a dietician to guide you on dietary changes that can help you control your blood glucose levels and manage your weight. Also, it is important for you to understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it is the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels.
