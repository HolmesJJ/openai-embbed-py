question: What can I do to prevent diabetes?
answer: Keeping your weight in check, maintaining an active lifestyle and eating a healthy diet can help prevent most cases of type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. A balanced diet consist of less sugar/sugary foods, less fat/fatty foods and less salt/salty foods. Include more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, whole grain cereals and breads. Remember to include fresh fruits and vegetables.
