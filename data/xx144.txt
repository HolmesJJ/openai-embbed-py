question: How does diabetes lead to reduced blood circulation?
answer: Diabetes can reduce or block blood flow to your legs, which may lead to gangrene (tissue death due to loss of blood supply) and even amputation. If you experience pain in the leg brought on by walking that is relieved with rest, or skin turning a darker colour (e.g., brown, purplish-blue, black), see a doctor immediately.
