question: What are the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?
answer: Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin, whereas in Type 2 diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or the insulin produced does not work. Type 1 diabetes most commonly presents in childhood and young adulthood. A family history puts a person at a slightly higher risk. Type 2 diabetes tends to occur in older people, above 40 years of age, especially those who are obese. Even though Type 2 diabetes is more common, it can be prevented. Type 1 diabetes can not.
