question: What is the recommended frequency and intensity of exercise?
answer: It is recommended to achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week. In addition to aerobic exercise, resistance strength training is also important for overall health and fitness. The key is to be consistent, so that you can lose weight steadily and sustainably without risking extreme muscle loss.
