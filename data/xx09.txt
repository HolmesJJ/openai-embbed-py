question: Will losing weight cure my diabetes?
answer: If you are overweight, losing weight may not definitely cure your diabetes. Nonetheless, losing 5-10% of your initial weight may help you control your blood glucose levels by improving insulin resistance. In addition, keeping the weight off may also help control your blood lipids and blood pressure.
