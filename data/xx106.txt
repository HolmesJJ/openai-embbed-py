question: I drink a lot of fruit juices or fizzy drinks. Does this cause diabetes?
answer: Your choice of beverage may not cause diabetes, as genetics also play a role in predisposing a person to diabetes. Nonetheless, fruit juices and fizzy drinks have high sugar content and are high in calories. When consumed in excess, these may cause obesity, which is a contributing factor for type 2 diabetes. Fruit juices are also high in fructose, another simple sugar like glucose. Over time, the pancreas will burn out and may not be able to produce sufficient insulin for the body to convert blood glucose into energy and to store glycogen. There will be a build-up of blood glucose in the red blood cells. This is the main sign of untreated or uncontrolled diabetes.
