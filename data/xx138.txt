question: What kinds of complications can diabetes cause?
answer: Diabetes can cause microvascular (small vessel) diseases like nerve damage, retinopathy, and kidney failure. To detect these early, go for regular screening. Diabetes can also cause macrovascular (medium and large vessel) complications like stroke, heart attack, and reduced blood circulation. Some ways to prevent these complications are exercising, losing excess weight, and quitting smoking.
