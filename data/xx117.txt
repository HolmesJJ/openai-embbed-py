question: I always feel hungry and eat a lot. But I noticed that I still lose weight. Why does this happen?
answer: If diabetes is not well-controlled, this can cause your body to starve, as well as you to feel hungry and eat more than ever. We need insulin because it acts as the key, to allow glucose to go in and out of the cells in the muscles and liver. When you do not have insulin, the muscles and liver cannot release the stored glucose or glycogen and convert it into fuel for your body. The body will then have to use fat and convert it into energy for the heart, lungs, and other body systems to function. This is why a person with undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes may lose weight.
