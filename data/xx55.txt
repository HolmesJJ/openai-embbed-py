question: What can I do if I have prediabetes?
answer: You can start with lifestyle changes with modest weight loss of about 5 to 10% of body weight; and doing moderate-intensity physical activity. For example, you can consider going for brisk walking and participating in strength training. Also, remember to eat healthily and sensibly, avoid fad diets, and get adequate sleep and rest.
