question: How can I get better at reading food labels?
answer: Here are some tips to help you read food labels.
    • Serving sizes and servings per container are located right at the top of the nutritional information panel. 
    • “Total carbohydrate” refers to the amount of starch, sugar, and fibres present in the food. It is important to bear in mind that sugar has already been included as total carbohydrate.
    • To compare between different brands of the same food, use the “per100g” column on the nutritional panel.
