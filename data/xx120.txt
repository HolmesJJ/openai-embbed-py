question: Why do I sometimes feel numb in my limbs, toes, and fingers?
answer: This is usually due to poor blood circulation. High levels of cholesterol and glucose in the blood can cause nerve damage or impede blood flow. Usually, numbness in the extremities, or the arms and legs, is an early sign of diabetes. With poorly controlled diabetes, you may first feel a tingling or burning sensation, or even numbness, when your blood glucose level is very high. Subsequently, the pain may worsen and is often described as a ‘stingy bite' or ‘nerve pain'. If the blood glucose level is not controlled over a period of time, you may lose all sensation in your lower limbs and feet. If you are experiencing numbness, it is best to consult a doctor to determine the cause.
