question: How can I manage my diabetes while travelling?
answer: Before you travel, consult your doctor to discuss your holiday plans and request for a travel memo. Also, check for time zone and weather differences that could affect the administering and storage of insulin, the nearest hospital available, as well as insurance coverage for diabetes-related emergencies. Always pack more insulin and oral diabetes medications in case your journey is delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. The same goes for other diabetes supplies such as blood glucose monitors, test strips, lancets and snacks.
