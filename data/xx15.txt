question: What are some strategies I can use to have a well-balanced diet?
answer: To consume less sugary foods, consider replacing sweetened beverages, sweets and cakes, with milk, fruit and wholemeal crackers. Tackle fatty foods by limiting intake of fried dishes and using less butter, ghee and coconut oil in cooking. Instead, opt for low fat cooking methods such as baking, boiling, grilling and steaming. To minimise salt intake, use less preserved food such as salted fish and canned meats, and more fresh products. Lastly, incorporate more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, wholegrain cereals and brains, and including fresh fruit and vegetables.
