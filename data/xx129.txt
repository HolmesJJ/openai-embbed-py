question: What is the difference between “No sugar” and “Sugar-free”?
answer: When the label on a bottle states, “No Sugar Added”, it means that the manufacturer does not add sugar to the product. However, the sugar content in jam comes from the fruit (fructose), and moderate consumption is advised. There is natural sugar in most of the foods we eat. For example, milk sugar (lactose) is found in dairy foods such as cheese and yoghurt. Chocolate sugar (maltose) can be found in malted beverages, and all types of flour, when absorbed in the digestive system, become glucose.
