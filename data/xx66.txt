question: How can diabetes affect my eyes?
answer: Diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy) results from reduced blood flow to the light-sensing nerve layer of the eye (retina). Over time, there is formation of fragile and leaky new blood vessels and nerve layer swelling. These changes can progress to blindness if not identified early or treated. There are two ways diabetes can affect your eyes: 1. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy and occure when the blood vessels become affected and start to leak and bleed. At this stage, vision is usually not affected. 2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs when there is growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye and these new vessels can rupture, causing significant bleeding that will lead to loss of vision.
