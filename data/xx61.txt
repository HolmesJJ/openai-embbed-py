question: Do I need to follow a low carb diet?
answer: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.
