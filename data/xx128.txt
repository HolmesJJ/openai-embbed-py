question: Does preserved food have higher calories?
answer: Yes, most preserved foods have higher calories because sugar is often added when the food is processed. Many vitamins are also lost when food is processed. It is always healthier to eat fresh produce. When buying processed food, you need to read food labels for details and not to be misled by words such as ‘sugar-free' and ‘cholesterol-free'.
