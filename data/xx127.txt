question: Can diabetics consume more brown rice and cereal?
answer: Brown rice and cereal are carbohydrates and a person with diabetes should limit their carbohydrate intake, as recommended by their dieticians. Brown rice, however, is considered to be healthier than white rice because it is unpolished and has more vitamins and fibre. The fibre in brown rice will keep a person feeling full longer.
