question: What puts me at risk of diabetic retinopathy?
answer: All individuals with diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (diabetic eye disease). After 20 years of having diabetes, most people will develop this complication to some degree. However, those who have poorly controlled diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetes retinopathy earlier and at more sever stages.
