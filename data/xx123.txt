question: What do kidneys do?
answer: Kidneys are the main excretory organs with millions of microscopic filtering units called nephrons. Kidneys filter the blood, removing urea and waste products, excess sugar, salts, and water in the urine. Kidneys control the amount of water in your body. The more you drink, the more urine excreted out.
