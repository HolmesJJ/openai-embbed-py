question: Can we store glucose in our body?
answer: Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.
