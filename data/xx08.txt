question: Since fat does not matter in relation to blood glucose levels, can I ignore the fat content in my meals?
answer: It is true that fat does not have a direct impact on blood glucose levels. However, a large amount of fat in a meal can delay stomach-emptying and slow the digestion of carbohydrates, keeping your blood glucose levels elevated for longer. This makes it difficult to keep your blood glucose levels within the desirable range. It should also be noted that fat provides nearly twice as many calories as carbohydrates and protein (gram for gram). This is not helpful for individuals hoping to shed some weight. Consuming too much saturated fat may also lead to undesirable lipid profiles, increasing your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
