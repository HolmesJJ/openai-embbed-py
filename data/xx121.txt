question: How does diabetes incapacitate?
answer: Some diabetics may accidentally cut the toe or foot and end up with a limb amputation. With poor blood circulation, the person may have lost all sensation in his feet and cannot feel pain. There is poor healing when infection sets in. The tissue in the leg becomes gangrenous and amputation may be required to save the patient's life. If you have diabetes, it is not safe to walk about barefooted. Pebble-stone reflexology is also highly discouraged because the sharp, rough stones may cut the feet.
