question: Can I still consume sweeteners if I am diabetic?
answer: Sweeteners can be safely consumed by diabetics as they do not increase blood sugar levels. They should, however, be taken in small amounts and occasionally. Excessive intake is not advisable because some sweeteners, based on certain forms of carbohydrate source, still contain calories. Sugar substitutes that are commonly available in Singapore include:
    • Aspartame (found in Equal)
    • Saccharin (Hermestas)
    • Sucralose (Splenda)
    • Stevia, a herbal product (Equal Stevia, Jovia)
    • Xylitol, a plant-based sugar alcohol (XyloSweet)
    • Acesulfame Potassium (found in carbonated drinks and protein shakes)
