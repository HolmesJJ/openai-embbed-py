question: How can I monitor my blood glucose levels during festive periods like Ramadan?
answer: During Ramadan fasting, you may experience decreased appetite, an urge to skip meals, and lower blood sugar levels. Hence, keep these tips on safe fasting in mind: 1) Delay having Suhoor, your pre-dawn meal, until it is as close as possible to the time for the Fajr prayer; 2) Eat sufficiently and moderately during Suhoor; 3) As soon as the sun has set, break the fast with Iftar without delay.
