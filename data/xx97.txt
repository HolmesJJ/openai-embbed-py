question: Why are wholegrains good for diabetes?
answer: There is evidence to show that people who include wholegrains in their diet are less likely to get Type 2 diabetes. Though we don't really know the exact reason why, it is believed that eating wholegrains can help control your blood glucose levels. The fibre in wholegrains take a longer time to digest, leading to a slower and lower spike in your blood glucose levels.
