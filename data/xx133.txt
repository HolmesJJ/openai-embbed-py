question: What causes insulin resistance and what can I do about it?
answer: One possible cause of insulin resistance is obesity and a high-calorie diet. A diet high in carbs, sugar, and fat increases calorie intake and contributes to obesity. Losing 5 to 10% of our body weight is enough to increase insulin sensitivity. Use My Healthy Plate or consult a dietician to guide you on how much to eat. Another cause of insulin resistance is lack of exercise. Do light workouts like walking and swimming to improve insulin insensitivity and help you lose excess weight. Insulin resistance may also be caused by factors like ethnicity, certain diseases, steroid use, some medications, older age, sleep problems, and smoking.
