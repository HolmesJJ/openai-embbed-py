question: How can diabetes ruin my sex life?
answer: Our reproductive system is rich in blood supply and has many nerves. Our nerves are located just next to the blood vessels and can be affected if diabetes is poorly controlled. If you are a man with diabetes, you may experience impotence or erectile dysfunction, and face difficulty when engaging in sexual intercourse. It is thus encouraged to seek help in the early stages of diabetes, where impotence can be prevented or resolved through proper control of the blood glucose level. If blood glucose is not controlled over a period of time, neuropathy or permanent nerve damage may set in.
