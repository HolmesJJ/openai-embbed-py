question: Why are diabetics prone to skin infections?
answer: When blood glucose is deposited inside the small blood vessels near the skin surface, the sluggish blood flow makes it easier for germs and fungi to multiply on the skin, especially in our warm and humid climate. Diabetics are prone to infections of the skin, mouth, urinary tract, and genital areas.
