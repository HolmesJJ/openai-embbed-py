question: How does diabetes affect my vision?
answer: Blood glucose that are deposited in the small blood vessels can cause them to narrow and increase blood pressure in the eyes, causing glaucoma. When glaucoma occurs, the narrow-damaged blood vessels may leak, and this is called retinopathy. Cataract is a white layer over the lens of the eye. If diabetes is coupled with hypertension, it may result in a tear of the retina and cause severe bleeding of the eyes, which can lead to blindness. Hence, it is important to seek prompt medical treatment if you see ‘floaters', ‘curtain falling' or something unusual happening to your vision.
