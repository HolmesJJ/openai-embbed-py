question: Can diabetes cause hypertension?
answer: Diabetes is often associated with cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, or high blood pressure. Hypertension usually causes no symptoms, but over time, it can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to stroke, heart attack or renal failure. While hypertension is usually picked up during a routine medical examination, if it reaches dangerously high levels, it can cause physical symptoms like headaches, visual disturbances, chest pain, or feeling breathless.
