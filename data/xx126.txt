question: What is so good about a high fibre diet?
answer: A high fibre diet consists of 2 servings of leafy vegetables and 2 servings of fruit per day. Fibre makes us feel full and we are unlikely to overeat. It stabilises the blood glucose level because it causes glucose to be absorbed into our bodies at a slower rate and gives insulin more time to work effectively. Fibre also prevents constipation and is good for the digestive system.
