question: How should I store my insulin pen?
answer: Once your insulin pen is in use, you do not have to keep it in a fridge. Store it at room temperature with a maximum storage temperature of approximately 25-30 Degrees Celsius. Do remember to label each pen with a date on the sticker and discard your used insulin pen 6 weeks after opening.
For brand-new insulin pens, store them in the fridge at approximately 2-8 Degrees Celsius. Please do not store insulin pens in the fridge and remember insulin pens from the fridge at least 30 minutes before injecting. Make sure to check the expiry date of insulin pens before injecting.
