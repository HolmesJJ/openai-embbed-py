question: Why do I feel thirsty all the time and experience frequent urination?
answer: When blood glucose level is too high and insulin is absent, the kidneys cannot reabsorb the excess glucose. This excess is then excreted in the urine. Whatever you drink is hence siphoned out of the body in the urine. The cells experience a water shortage, you feel thirsty, and your brain will signal you to drink more water. Frequent urination can be an early sign of high blood glucose levels. If you have been experiencing frequent urination, it is advisable for you to have your blood glucose level checked.
