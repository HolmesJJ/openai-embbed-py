question: What does a well-balanced diet consist of?
answer: A well-balanced diet consists of less sugar, less fat, less salt, and more fibre. Health Promotion Board's My Healthy Plate sets a good benchmark for the major food groups you should target to have in each meal. In one plate, half should be filled with fruits and vegetables, one-quarter with wholegrains, and the remaining one-quarter with meat and others.
