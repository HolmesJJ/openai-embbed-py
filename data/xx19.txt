question: How can I differentiate hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia?
answer: Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, happens when the blood glucose level falls below 4.0 mmol/L. Some early symptoms include shakiness, sweating and fast heartbeat. Hypoglycemia may also happen while you are sleeping, and some tell-tale signs are seizures, headaches, and feeling tired or confused upon waking. Hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose, results in thirst, frequent urination and even weight loss.
