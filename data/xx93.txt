question: I think I have hypoglycaemia, what should I do?
answer: If you have hypoglycaemia (blood glucose level less than 4.0 mmol/L), apply the 15/15 Rule. Take 15 g of carbohydrates represented by 4-5 glucose tablets OR 3 teaspoons of sugar with half cup water OR 150ml-200ml of soft drink OR 150ml of fruit juice. After 15 minutes, recheck your blood glucose. If your blood glucose level is still less than 4.0 mmol/L, repeat the previous step, if not proceed to the next step. Next step: If your next meal is more than an hour away, consume a snack containing 15 g of long-acting carbohydrates such as a slice of bread OR 3 pieces of biscuits.
