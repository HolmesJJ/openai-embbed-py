question: Can certain fruit or vegetable juices lower my blood glucose level?
answer: Many people believe bitter gourd juice counteracts the sweetness of blood glucose. This has not been scientifically proven. Others believe that celery and green apple juices have the same effect. These beliefs are also scientifically unproven. Fibre, however, can lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels. It is recommended that people with diabetes take 20 to 35g of fibre per day.
