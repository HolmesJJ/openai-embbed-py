question: If I have diabetes, does that mean I can never consume starchy foods?
answer: No. Carbohydrate foods, particularly starchy foods such as rice, bread, noodles and cereals, form a major component of the body's energy source. All starchy foods break down to glucose, which is the body's preferred source of energy. The key is knowing how much your personalised requirements for carbohydrates are. Choose starchy foods that are high in fibre such as wholegrains.
