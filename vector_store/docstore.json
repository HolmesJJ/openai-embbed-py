Consume 15g of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as half a can of soft drink (e.g. Original Coca Cola) or half a glass of fruit juice. Then, have 15 minutes of rest. Afterwards, maintain your blood glucose level by consuming 15g of long-acting carbohydrates, such as 1 slice of bread or 3 pieces of plain biscuits. Take note to avoid highly sugary snacks, as overeating may cause your blood glucose levels to rise too much. Also, avoid taking beverages such as Milo and coffee which contain fat and prevent absorption of glucose into your bloodstream.\n", "doc_id": "43c6239b-3aa7-45ba-80d7-c89afca2a3fa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8d454c53c987e5688da279cc3f8a3b33e2a5d0296575a0f98bdcdd8d7889573c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 904}, "relationships": {"1": "002cf5a1-d6c9-4388-813a-addfd0c7df43"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9146e5ce-a04f-421d-9f73-486181fe0697": {"__data__": {"text": "question: If I have diabetes, does that mean I can never consume fruits?\nanswer: People with diabetes should still eat all kinds of fruits, as they are rich sources of antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and fibre.

Anyone, even a child, can be taught to perform the test and it is essential for a person with diabetes to operate the glucometer. Another way is to take the HbA1c (haemoglobin A1c) test, which reflects average blood glucose control for a three-month period. Haemoglobin A1c in the red blood cells (glycohemoglobin) are glycated or sugar coated. The body usually replaces red blood cells every three months. This is usually done quarterly in the laboratory.

We need insulin because it acts as the key, to allow glucose to go in and out of the cells in the muscles and liver. When you do not have insulin, the muscles and liver cannot release the stored glucose or glycogen and convert it into fuel for your body.

Carbs and sugar get broken down into glucose. A high-carb, high-sugar diet means we need more insulin to process all that glucose. Over time, this could overwork and damage the pancreas, causing it to produce less insulin. To combat this, avoid eating too many portions of refined carbs (e.g., white rice, white bread) and sugary foods. Another possible factor that causes insulin shortage is obesity and a fatty pancreas. Obesity causes fat to gather in the pancreas. The more fat in the pancreas, the less insulin it makes. To shed pancreatic fat, you need to lose excess weight.\nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes.\n", "doc_id": "9d414db3-f5fe-4f69-8c0f-4ab786bf384a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b575c16e97d9d1137f2ffbc026a2ac7f35a4941c7a0c6e40723095c9ffa34cea", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 827}, "relationships": {"1": "aef98767-a6d2-442a-b544-cb741c6f76df"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6017df50-ab26-4f4a-8ff3-66bd39216ea0": {"__data__": {"text": "question: Who is most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes?\nanswer: You're more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you:\n- Are overweight or obese (BMI of 23.0 kg/m\u00b2 or higher)\n- Lead an inactive lifestyle\n- Are 40 years old and above\n- Have a parent or sibling with diabetes\n- Have a history of gestational diabetes\n- Have impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose\n- Have abnormal blood cholesterol or lipid levels\n- Have high blood pressure\nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes.\n", "doc_id": "6017df50-ab26-4f4a-8ff3-66bd39216ea0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d26cbfca8162baffc7f39b78840415a1632de8fa2aed4c0652ad6747213ed6ee", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 559}, "relationships": {"1": "4526af11-1bdc-46cb-adf0-6d29619262a8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d817165f-b4a9-4f22-b4f4-0c078e532889": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What are some common symptoms of diabetes?\nanswer: Diabetes symptoms might be so mild they go unnoticed.

Even during fasting periods, your liver releases stored glucose into your blood. People with diabetes havea relatively higher glucose release from their liver, hence your glucose may be high even when you have not eaten anything. \n2. Your body may be producing stress hormones during an illness. Medications prescribed during illnesses (e.g. steroids) can also increase glucose levels. \n3.

In serious situations, hypoglycemia can result in diabetic comas that may be life-threatening, especially for those who are not consuming sufficient carbohydrates and are currently on diabetic medications. A balanced diet is essential for diabetes management. Eat more wholegrains instead of refined grains, and enjoy a variety of other carbohydrate-containing food, including low-fat yoghurt, fruits, beans and vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and sweet potatoes.

GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre.

The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. A balanced diet consist of less sugar/sugary foods, less fat/fatty foods and less salt/salty foods. Include more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, whole grain cereals and breads. Remember to include fresh fruits and vegetables.\nSource: Harvard School of Public Health & Win Against Diabetes Booklet\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/disease-prevention/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/#:~:text=Beyond%20individual%20behavior,healthy%20diet%2C%20and%20not%20smoking..\n", "doc_id": "13a71454-c243-42c0-9c6e-af89f31ae1ce", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "338c37f72388e2d557c00af5ce14c76c9aa06edd5954626402a1efa6c37f17cb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1047}, "relationships": {"1": "5e6569f6-2281-407c-8ef9-cd4883904769"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
