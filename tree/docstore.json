Even during fasting periods, your liver releases stored glucose into your blood. People with diabetes havea relatively higher glucose release from their liver, hence your glucose may be high even when you have not eaten anything. \\n2. Your body may be producing stress hormones during an illness. Medications prescribed during illnesses (e.g. steroids) can also increase glucose levels. \\n3. Consumption of larger meals, that are high in carbohydrates and fat, at late hours can lead to higher post-meal blood glucose levels over an extended period of time.,Hence, it is advised to consume your last meal 3 hours before bedtime and try brisk walking for 30 minutes daily.

Glucose enters the bloodstream, and the level of blood glucose begins to rise. When our body senses an increase in blood glucose, it sends a signal to the pancreas to produce more insulin to lower the blood glucose level. If the blood glucose level is still high, more insulin will be produced to enter the bloodstream. The insulin acts as a key to unlock the body's cells and allow glucose to pass from the bloodstream into the cells. The blood glucose level falls as glucose is transferred to the cells.

The onset of type 1 diabetes is often sudden, affecting children and young people below the age of 30. While more young and overweight people have developed type 2 diabetes in recent years, it usually occurs in the 40s. The cause of type 1 diabetes may be unknown; however, some people develop it after a bout of illness such as a viral infection. For type 2 diabetes, many have a family history of the disease.

A diet suitable for diabetes is a healthy eating plan that is individualised according to your requirements and lifestyle. It is recommended to achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week. Sugar-free products may still contain carbohydrates in the form of starch that can increase blood glucose levels. Bitter-tasting foods do not help lower blood glucose levels. People with diabetes should avoid alcohol in general. Healthy snacking options include 1 small apple, 10 grapes, 1 wedge of papaya, 1 small pear, 1 medium banana, and 1 glass of low fat or high calcium soy milk with less sugar.

Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetic eye disease that results from reduced blood flow to the light-sensing nerve layer of the eye (retina).
